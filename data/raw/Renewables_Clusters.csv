China,,Financial Cross-Cutters,"Late start leveraged relative technological maturity with aggressive upfront state subsidies targeting large and capable players(winners) for growth,  backed by development bank led financing till installations reach targets "
Germany,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"Municipalities can be change agents under the right context in wealthy decentralised political regions with public support where they have policy making, coordinating, planning and advisory roles. They key challenges they can overcome is in policy coordination between complex systems in urban regions where they can create synergestic windows for a wide umbrella of actors to achieve energy sector coupling. "
Kazakhstan,Adaptive_Transition ,Adaptive_Pragmatists,"Post-Soviet and oil dependent economies can make progress on RE goals by adopting better targetting and structured policy support. Key enablers include market confidence and liberalisation, increased accountability and improvements in quality of governance. "
Senegal,,Financial Cross-Cutters,"For countries with signficant dependencies on international finance energy sector reform can be harnessed to increase energy output and efficiency along with reducing oil dependence and increasing renewable penetration, coordinated with tax, regulatory and contractual incentives aimed at attracting private investment this can lead to major gains in RE penetration. However States must be cautious as they increased role of private capital can weaken autonomy and limit state ability to make energy policy in the face major financial disparity and dependencies, weak land use rights systems can lead to greater challenges in equity and energy justice despite major gains in RE. "
ASEAN,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Competitive Feed-in-Tariff Rate, with low-pre-existing market share allowed growth. C#lear RE policy targets announced 2 years prior to coming into effect"
Asia–Pacific,,Adaptive_Pragmatists,For developing economies political stability and administrative efficiency is assumed to increase the  credibility of policies. Strategic policies including mid-term goals are important policy design factors in promoting renewable electricity capacity. For least developed economies rural off-grid electrification is a central motivation for pushing renewable energy adoption (Afghanistan).
United States,,Market_Based,"Policy mix of netmetering, Subsidy and Ongoing production incentives helped drive adoption by reducing cost burden for consumer adoption"
Korea,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"FiT policy can lead to RE takeoff but cost-structuring must be sustainable, RPS can lower the financial strain but policy transitions must be communicated and presented in advance else leading to disruption costs. "
"Apulia , Tuscany",Devolved_Governance ,Regional_Autonomy,"Regional devolution of energy policy for regions with heterogenieties in states and strong cultural and social values, enabling local governments to create their own approaches to RE policy with emphasis on land-use and energy consenting, this facilitates long term public acceptance and policy stability"
Scotland ,,Regional_Autonomy,"Devoltion can be centralised at the regional level to leverage strategic policies choices and enact scale dependent decisions like technology commitment and infrastrucutre, local stakeholders have to be incorporated but there must be provisions for policy prioritization. "
Vietnam,State_Directed_Strategic,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,For economies where solar PV is not part of electricity generation Fit-in tariffs with tax exemption can establish a new economy sector conditional to public acceptance and resource availability.
Germany,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"Robust FIT market independent regime at Federal Level with price guarantees for all renewable technologies for two decades, incentivising small investors and widespread deployment in states with lower income to seek growth in RE. "
Austria ,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"Procurment policy supercharged by national level FIT system which opened up investment into the RE production, later amended to improve cost-efficiency."
China,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Policy makers took interest in innovations in nascent PV industry comminicating support, enabling market investment, coupled with FIT, Subsidy and RD investment as Industry Matured. "

China,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Addressing Solar Curtailment the Central Government drastically re-organised the solar policy regime, lowering targets, FIT rates and subsidy rules to put a stop to faster than expected solar expansion"
United States,,Market_Based,"Stringent RPS targets which ambitous shares can induce compliance with the target for utilities providers, and even lead to consisent target over-shoot and economies of scale in states with abundant renewables capacity. However for states with less RE potential, RPS targets might lead to underinvestment in RE not covered under RPS due to path dependencies and utility expectation formations. Additional capacity at the utility providers level for more planning and flexibility might allow for  more dynamic utility performance. "
Chile ,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"For states transitioning from a state based energy system towards a Market_Based energy system, reforms can be leveraged in successive waves to create policy success in RE deployment. This requires strategic planning and investments in the entire energy system from generation to distribution. Independent institutions are key in long term planning and policy success. There is however risk of high market concentration and low-civic participation in these processes which can maintain or reinforce PE structures. "
Germany,,Financial Cross-Cutters,Pro-active national development bank in the prescence of a distributed and environmentally oriented market and institutional fabric was able to transform the risk profile in conjuction with generous and stable fiscal policy in FiTs and coordination with grid which then allowed investors of all sizes to partake in RE expansion and at lower IRR due to values. 
China,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Strong state prescence in chinese economy and energy system through competing large SOEs mitigated part of the risk in RE investment despite the knowledge and skill gap in the financial sector, this led to corporate finance and in conjuction with the CDB policy of national champion picking the RE sector was dominated by large projects by large firms with limited access to private, small and medium sized players. Risk mitigation was possible thanks to the strong centralisation and connections between the players reducing coordination failures in the otherwise information poor market.  "

Uganda ,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,Government and international development assisted project employing elaborate de-risking and creditor protection provided financing options to project developers who were selected under an auction scheme and winners were offered a fixed rate FIT contract with premiums on successful completion 
Korea ,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"For states with increasing share in RE the policy pivot from inducing RE production towards maintaining RE policy sustainability and scalability is key, in the Korean case the shift away from FiT was motivated by unsustainable cost and administrative burdens. RPS has proven successful but problems in grid internconnetion and reinforcement block the process, the unique aspects of having a national utility provider concentrates this grid risk. Reforms to streamline grid interconnections and facilitating more incentives non-wind solar renewales helps diversify RE intermittency and geographical spread, for grid expansion itself strategic planning with dynamic reviews is critical. "
California,Blended_Finance,Financial Cross-Cutters,Easier Solar Approvals Process Required Local Governments to remove admistrative barriers to residential solar for sub 10KW projects reducing barriers to homeowner adoption.

Iran,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"The effectiveness of FIT depends on socio-economic readiness (such as a skilled workforce), political stability and the share of private investment."
UK,,Regional_Autonomy,"Spatial aspects of the energy policy bring critical tensions between the regional and national levels of policymakers, while devolution and localisation enhance the reach of RE policy they are not sufficient as seen in the case of Northern Ireland and Wales with greater stakeholder participation inviting more dissent and roadblocks. Success in the Scottish case was through a unique mix of long term poltical concensus, an active network of policy entrepreneurs and strategic centralisation of large investments and projects. "
China,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"Economic policies (FIT) combined with signalling of policy support and targets to satisfy the political objective of green growth in countries with high polution and abundant wind resources. (Price policy was more effective in areas with poor wind resources, whilst non- price policy was more effective in areas with rich wind resources.)"
Germany,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"The creation of a diverse interest group can be facilitated by a distributed bottom up policy architecture which can successfully circumnavigate around entrenched incumbents, however this policy regime has high complexity and maintenance costs and can create substantial lock-in with unclear long term economic sustainability. "
"EU, China",,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Countries with sizeable wind power potential and expansion, can be motivated by reduced air pollution, energy security and employment to allocate large scale investments into wind power."

Sweden,,Regional_Autonomy,"Facing slow RE progress national policy was formulated to strategically  leverage Sweden's decentralised political structure distributing  and building competence, capacity and resposibility with diverse stakeholders. "
UK,,Market_Based,"Liberal Market Economies can struggle to achieve directional coordination required for market based structural change, the UK shows the value of policy experimentation and learning in conjuction with legal frameworks to singal commitment and the value of adopting a technology specific approach over neutral approaches. "
China,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"For Coordinated market economies like china strong executive policies can be applied across economic sectors leading to coordinated emissions reductions between industrial consumers and energy producers, however this also opens up issues in institutional prioritization with China displaying higher focus on industrial policy leading to more focus on installations and manufacturing capacity over grid connections and dispatch. Complex political dynamics and informational and power assymettries can lead to challenges in enforecement when climate is not a high agenda item. "
China,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Ecological Civiliation is an ideological mix of EMT and strategic industry theory, under this ideological framework China's RE industry has been developed to harness ecological modernism while building a strategic industry in multiple arenas from energy security to economic export orientation, the strong state direction mixed with concentrated SOEs enabled rapid progress however the complexity of coordination and economic incentives create large bottlenecks for the future. "
United States,,Financial Cross-Cutters,"States implement financial tools to reduce up-front costs for residential solar using subsidies, tax breaks, loan financing. Legal support is also provided through solar rights "
Annex 2,,Financial Cross-Cutters,"For countries with developing financial  markets where access to credit and equity markets is inadequate for RE projects due to risk from illiquid investments and insufficient knowledge and skills in the finance and energy sectors, multilateral mechanisms like CDM can play a powerful role through financing options, providing access to credit, equity and liquidity as well as providing knowledge skills and a clear market signal for the support of these technologies. Policy makers in similar regions can employ financial sector reform to reap similar benefits in RE deployment. "
Germany,,Distributed_Industrial_Policy ,"Strategic policy to create an emissions avoidance industry via FiTs required a strong coalition with ample fiscal capacity on the state, this enabled collective investment in technologies which were not quite cost-competitive to reach cost-competitiveness and drove diverse investement across multiple RE technology. Pitfalls include insufficient attention to regressive dimensions of FiT pricing and grid cost balancing. "
China,,Centralized_Industrial_Policy,"Countries planning renewables expansion need to take into account coordination challenges in both supply and demand to achieve sustainable growth, The chinese case shows coordination in supply side policy with insufficient demand side coordination. Key benefits from chinese centralisation was easy access to finance with strong subsidy program designed to boost domestic industry however failure to keep up with grid and demand leading to oversupply of unusable wind energy and oversupply of wind manufacturing. "
Brazil,,Adaptive_Pragmatists,"A diverse overllapping policy mix needs synergistic and reinforcing effects, focusing on last mile and distributed energy generation can tackle vulnerabilities in RE grid expansion while expanding energy security to the periphery. "
